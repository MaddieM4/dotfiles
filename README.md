# Maddie's Dotfiles

I'm trying to move more and more of my personal computing experience into public
repositories of clean content. That way it's easy to build a new system whenever
I want. Right now the best reference for how to do stuff is:

https://maddiem4.cc/site/setup

One thing that might be nice is making this repo a wizard to entirely replace
that document with true automation. I'd like to do that at some point. In the
meantime, consider that link the instructions for making use of this repo.
